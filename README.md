At this stage a Reverb and an Delay are already implemented. 


As I am a beginner in flutter programming I get a lot of help from Claude (Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet) who lives in my VS Code Extension Continue Dev.

and also I use Olllama and qwen2.5.-coder 7B with Continue as chat codecorrection alternative.

Last but not least I use Starcoder2 for autocompletion

This project was deeply inspired by the amazing work of Dr. Angela Yu and her Flutter Programming Course. I really really hope she will update her Course really soon! It is didactly the best course I attended!
